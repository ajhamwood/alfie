# Goal
Artificial life meta-explorer

# Concept
## Artificial life must have
* A manifold: global and local structure, notion of proximity (but not necessarily distance)
* "Individuals" embedded within the manifold
* Constant transformation of individuals (executed/steppable globally or locally)
* Content and expression of individuals: eg state and update function
## For artificial life to engage with a fitness space, it also must have
* Individuals constructed using randomness, destroyed using non-randomness
  * What about big-step randomness with tapering cutoff?
* Manifold diameter and population magnitude must be sufficient to support regional variation
  * What about regional variation in variability?
* What about individual variability in both value and structure of content?
* What about the existence of conserved properties? Are these merely statements derivable from expression?
* What about transformation of the manifold?
