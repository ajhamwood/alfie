        <p>Plainly speaking, this page is being built around a different kind of experience to the one expected by the above fictitious attributee. If you know what you're looking for you can find any specific section independent of all the others. But if it's your first time here, I hope you will take the time to engage with this project on its own terms.</p>
        <p>"Alfie" is intended to be an effort to collect different examples of what can be described as "artificial life"—the definition of which it is hoped a satisfactory one will be stumbled upon in due time. Where different examples exhibit similarities that are generlisable I will be grouping them together, so that other choices their differences suggest might also be explored.</p>
        <p>However, objective goals such as some Grand Unified Theory of artificial life, or a complete list of examples, aren't the point. For example, if a particular class of examples is going to be presented here, it's likely that that presentation will be embedded in a discussion that includes the example within it. By including these reflections alongside functionality, it is intended that a methodology alternative to an objective, "positivist" analysis might be modelled.</p>
        <p>Lastly, while the academic style provides a useful narrative framing, this project should be understood not as a scientific or commercialising effort, but rather an aesthetic-philosophical one.</p>
